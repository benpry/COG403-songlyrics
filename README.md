**Gender Analysis Result:**
![](results/gender_analysis_result.png)
- Since the offsets are positive in both cases, books were ahead of songs in both cases
- Since the offset for females is smaller than for males, female artists introduce new words into their lyrics more frequently than male artists
- Since the p values are 0, these are statistically significant values

**Age Analysis Result:**
![](results/age_analysis_result.png)
- Mean offset is negative for every group other than 20to30, which means songs were ahead of books in these cases
- and in age 20to30 songs were behind books
- The value is not significant for group 30to40, but is significant for all others
