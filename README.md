# COG403-songlyrics

This repository contains analysis code for the paper "The Role of Song Lyrics in Linguistic Change" by Ria Prakash and Ben Prystawski.

The "code" folder contains all the code used to run the analysis, with the following subfolders:

read_data: files to read the MusixMatch data, get years of recording, artist age, artist gender. Also code that reads the google Ngram data (read_ngrams.R) and computes yearly relative frequencies (compute_aggregate_song_frequencies.py).

compare_word_trajectories: files to perform time-lag cross correlation and Granger causality testing, either in aggregate, by genre, 

topic_modelling_analysis: files that apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify topics in lyrics. This ultimately didn't make it into the paper as it was hard to identify what the topics represented from their top few words, but we still include the code here.

The "data" folder contains intermediate code used in the analysis. The "processed" subfolder contains intermediate files generated by the files in read_data.

The "figures" folder contains both notebooks that generate figures from the data and the figures themselves.
